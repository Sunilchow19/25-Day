      <p>With the untimely death of his beloved wife still bitter in his mouth,
        John Wick, the expert former assassin, receives one final gift from her--a
        precious keepsake to help John find a new meaning in life now that she is
        gone. But when the arrogant Russian mob prince, Iosef Tarasov, and his men
        pay Wick a rather unwelcome visit to rob him of his prized 1969 Mustang
        and his wife's present, the legendary hitman will be forced to unearth his
        meticulously concealed identity. Blind with revenge, John will immediately
        unleash a carefully orchestrated maelstrom of destruction against the
        sophisticated kingpin, Viggo Tarasov, and his family, who are fully aware
        of his lethal capacity. Now, only blood can quench the boogeyman's thirst
        for retribution.</p>

      <p>Condemned by the tyrannical High Table to be on the run for the rest of
        his life, deadly assassin maestro John Wick (2014) embarks on a Sisyphean
        mission of suicidal fury to decide his fate after the merciless carnage in

        Baba Yaga, the grim messiah of death, must make every bullet count in this
