    <p>
      This is the story of a humble vanara who forgot his divinity but was
      awoken to embrace his true power and wisdom and become an immortal legend.
      A growing darkness threatens to tear the universe apart and all hope now
      lies in the journey of a young hero. When Hanuman's power was taken from
      him as a child, he must go on a journey of self-discovery to remember the
      god inside of him. Hanuman's quest will take him through a vast world of
      characters, demons, lost cities, cultures and forest beings with their
      rivalries, alliances and wars. At each stage he and his companions must
      overcome unthinkable challenges to save all existence. Through their
      adventures, Hanuman and his companions will once again inspire audiences
      to learn that the true measure of a hero is not defined from power, but
      from faith, courage, hope and compassion. This is the legend of Hanuman.
